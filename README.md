Live Website: https://elliotisnt.github.io/loading-bars/

A dark-mode gallary of loading bars from various webpages I've visited. The list is randomized every time to the page is open to prevent alphabetic sorting.

Features
  - Dark-mode palette
  - Dynamic CSS grid fits any screen
  - Loads collection from GitHub API
  - Random shuffle on page load
  - CSS spin animation applied to static images (mimicking originals that spun via HTML)
